        <h1>Nonviolent Communication</h1>

        <br />

        <p>Nonviolent CommunicationSM (NVC) is sometimes referred to as compassionate communication. Its purpose is to
          strengthen our ability to inspire compassion from others and to respond compassionately to others and to
          ourselves. NVC guides us to reframe how we express ourselves and hear others by focusing our consciousness on
          what we are observing, feeling, needing, and requesting.</p>

        <p>We are trained to make careful observations free of evaluation, and to specify behaviors and conditions that
          are affecting us. We learn to hear our own deeper needs and those of others, and to identify and clearly
          articulate what we are wanting in a given moment. When we focus on clarifying what is being observed, felt,
          and needed, rather than on diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of our own compassion. Through its
          emphasis on deep listening—to ourselves as well as others—NVC fosters respect, attentiveness and empathy, and
          engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart. The form is simple, yet powerfully transformative.</p>

        <p>While it is taught through the use of a concrete <a
            href="http://www.cnvc.org/Training/the-nvc-model">model</a>,
          and is referred to as "a process of
          communication" or a "language of compassion," Nonviolent Communication is more than a process or a language.
          As our cultural conditioning often leads our attention in directions unlikely to get us what we want, NVC
          serves as an ongoing reminder to focus our attention on places that have the potential to yield what we are
          seeking—a flow between ourselves and others based on a mutual giving from the heart.</p>

        <p>Founded on language and communication skills that enable us to remain human, even under trying conditions,
          Nonviolent Communication contains nothing new: all that has been integrated into NVC has been known for
          centuries. The intent is to remind us about what we already know—about how we humans were meant to relate to
          one another—and to assist us in living in a way that concretely manifests this knowledge.</p>

        <p>The use of NVC does not require that the persons with whom we are communicating be literate in NVC or even
          motivated to relate to us compassionately. If we stay with the principles of NVC, with the sole intention to
          give and receive compassionately, and do everything we can to let others know this is our only motive, they
          will join us in the process and eventually we will be able to respond compassionately to one another. While
          this may not happen quickly, it is our experience that compassion inevitably blossoms when we stay true to the
          principles and process of Nonviolent Communication.</p>

        <h2>Nonviolent Communication Skills</h2>

        <br />

        <p>As the name implies, this approach to communication emphasizes compassion as the motivation for action rather
          than fear, guilt, shame, blame, coercion, threat or justification for punishment. In other words, it is about
          getting what you want for reasons you will not regret later. These techniques allow you to make conscious
          choices about how you will respond whether you get what you want, or not. It is definitely NOT about guilt and
          tricking people into giving you what you want.</p>

        <p>The skills are built on Dr. Marshall B. Rosenberg's application of Nonviolent Communication. The process of
          NVC encourages us to focus on what we and others are observing, how and why we are each feeling as we do, what
          our underlying needs are, and what each of us would like to have happen. These skills emphasize personal
          responsibility for our actions and the choices we make when we respond to others.</p>

        <p>Nonviolent Communication skills will assist you in dealing with major blocks to communication such as
          demands, diagnoses and blaming. In CNVC trainings you will learn to express your feelings without attacking.
          This will help minimize the likelihood of facing defensive reactions in others. The skills will help you make
          clear requests. They will help you receive critical and hostile messages without taking them personally,
          giving in, or losing self-esteem. These skills will be useful with your family, friends, students,
          subordinates, supervisors, co-workers and clients. These skills will be useful with your own internal
          dialogues.</p>

        <p>NVC is a clear and effective model for communicating in a way that is cooperative, conscious, and
          compassionate. </p>
