              <h2>Choose Your Words</h2>
              <p>Communicating effectively with a client or patient who has a mental illness can be a challenge. This
                guidebook is an introduction to an approach called Nonviolent Communication (NVC); a set of
                communication strategies that allow you to develop clear, compassionate connections with the people who
                look to you for help. NVC creates mutually satisfying exchanges and creates safety so that deep levels
                of healing can be realized. You will learn to notice when you are using language in ways that are likely
                to trigger defensive reactions and how to choose language which allows authenticity, understanding and
                trust to flourish.</p>

              <h2>Choose Your Words: Workbook</h2>
              <p>Communicating with a friend or relative who has been diagnosed with a mental illness can be confusing
                and painful. Patterns of interactions can occur that leave everyone feeling sad, hurt and lonely. This
                guidebook offers a system called Nonviolent Communication that will give you specific tools you can use
                to heal painful interactions, create loving connections, and maintain honest, open dialogues. You will
                learn how to transform negative patterns and bridge the gap that separates you from your loved ones;
                find out what words are likely to trigger defensive reactions from others; and discover what you can say
                that will create open-hearted communication. The guidebook demonstrates how to be compassionate to
                others even when you don't agree with their point of view, and will offer ways you can care for yourself
                in the mist of the challenges you are facing.</p>
