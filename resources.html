            <h3>How Learning and Applying NVC Can Help You Achieve Physical Wellness</h3>

            <p>Learning and experiencing NVC improves physical heath in a number of ways. One thing that happens when
              you
              begin to work with a NVC practitioner is that you get empathy for the emotional wounds you have been
              carrying
              around all your life. When you are accurately heard for your experience and its effect on you in the
              present
              day, you begin to release it. As you release the wound your shoulders relax, your jaw unclenches or
              perhaps
              the knot in your stomach dissolves. Where ever you have been storing your pain is now free to let go. As
              you
              find the root of your pain and develop self compassion and compassion for others, habitual reactions also
              change. The following example written by a NVC student will help illustrate how healing on this level
              happens.
            </p>

            <p>Before I found out about NVC I was in a lot of physical distress. Every time my buttons got pushed (which
              was
              often) my heart rate would accelerate and I would have heart arrhythmias. I went to a traditional
              therapist
              and talked about my reactions but since I didn't know how to own and transform my pain, the arrhythmias
              continued. My medial doctor wanted to put me on heart medication to control the symptoms. I didn't want to
              just control the symptoms; I wanted to heal the underlying cause. When I found a NVC practitioner to work
              with, I felt a great deal of relief after only one session. I discovered that what I needed when I was
              experiencing emotional pain was empathy. I thought that I knew what empathy was but I found out that I was
              mistaken. My traditional therapist had done some active listing and had given me some advice. This is not
              empathy and did not help me. Empathy allowed me the non-judgmental space to explore the roots of my
              reactions.
              I noticed that once I found the root of my reaction, a shift occurred in my body and I felt calm. My body
              relaxed, my heart calmed down, the arrhythmias went away. Then I learned new tools for dealing with
              situations
              that pushed my buttons. That gave me confidence in my ability to cope with life and helped me change
              habitual
              patterns of reacting and responding to others.</p>

            <p>According to Christiane Northrup, MD every emotion we experience is a biochemical reality in the body.
              When
              we have life affirming beliefs and heal our emotional issues our physical health improves. When we carry
              negative beliefs and emotional pain, our health is negatively affected. When we perpetuate negative
              behavior
              patterns, we adversely affect our own health and that of others. Christiane says in order to prevent heart
              disease we must be willing to enter the unhealed places in our hearts. When we have opened ourselves to
              our
              own pain and suffering then we can be open to others. We can live with open hearts. If we refuse to be
              with
              our own pain but repress it, it will make itself known on a physical level. We either become conscious of
              our
              emotional pain and work to heal it or it will express itself indirectly through our bodies.</p>

            <p>Alice Miller in her book, The Body Never Lies, tells the story about a woman who had uterine cancer. Once
              the
              woman owned and healed the feelings that she had been afraid to face, the cancer went away. This woman had
              been lying to herself all her life because her true feelings went against maintaining cultural myths.
              Being
              honest and facing feelings that may be socially unacceptable could save your life.</p>

            <p>When learning Nonviolent Communication we become aware of how we were conditioned. We learn what
              conditioning
              is and what conditioning is not inside of ourselves which brings us face to face with our essential self.
              Illusions we may have had about ourselves and others dissolve and we learn to interact with reality
              instead of
              with our illusions of reality. We learn to listen to our gut or our instincts. We become connected with
              our
              feelings and needs and with the sensations that are happening in our bodies. By listening to ourselves on
              this
              level we find out how to better nurture our selves physically, spiritually, emotionally and on all other
              levels. This promotes wellness through improved self care. Strategies to take care of ourselves expand and
              we
              are no longer trapped in the same unconscious patterns that we have utilized in the past in an attempt to
              get
              unconscious needs met. Some of these strategies include using food, alcohol, sex and drugs to avoid
              dealing
              with our feelings. Other strategies that people use that are ineffective in addressing the underlying
              needs
              are harming other people, harming ourselves or destroying property. As we learn new ways of nurturing
              ourselves and others, we feel better physically, mentally and spiritually.</p>

            <p>The process of NVC clarifies what are feelings and needs. It gives us a language for expressing our
              internal
              world and tools to use that help us get our needs met. Learning to communicate decreases stress. Stress
              creates illness. As we become more competent in communicating and getting our needs met we feel happier.
              Happiness breeds health and well being.</p>

            <h3>Natural Language vs. Habitual or Normal Language</h3>


            <p>Our natural language is the expression of feelings and needs. Babies cry when they are hungry or tired or
              uncomfortable. They express their feelings in order to get their needs met. If they were not born with
              this
              mechanism in place they would not be cared for optimally. Through this mechanism they learn how to control
              the
              environment; how to get their needs met for love, attention, comfort, nutrition, safety.</p>

            <p>As babies develop, the natural language of feelings and needs becomes distorted. The growing child
              observes
              how other people communicate and they begin to be conditioned out of their natural language and into the
              'normal' language of their society. Their expression of feelings and needs begins to change to conform to
              the
              language around them. They learn that it's not okay to express feelings directly least they are labeled a
              'cry
              baby' or stimulate irritation in others. When they ask for what they want directly, they may be called
              'selfish'. The developing child may be told, "If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
              They learn to stifle their negative feelings and can develop shame for having them. Some people disconnect
              from their feelings as a self protection mechanism (If it is shameful to have certain feelings, then it is
              better not to know that they are happening.) Instead of owning their feelings and taking responsibility
              for
              them, they learn to project them on others in the form of blame, judgment, analysis, labels and diagnosis.
              Soon this pattern of self expression overrides the natural expression of feelings and needs and becomes
              habitual.</p>

            <p>Expressing ourselves using habitual language becomes a recipe for disaster. When we express what we want
              by
              blaming or judging others, we either won't get it (because when people hear blame or judgment their
              natural
              desire to give shuts off) or if we do get what we want through blaming, shaming, 'guilting' others there
              will
              be a price to pay. When people give to us out of fear, guilt, shame, or obligation they feel resentful.
              Resentment contaminates a relationship. Since we are all socialized to get our needs met in unconscious
              ways
              our relationships can be dysfunctional, painful and confusing. We lack tools to resolve conflicts and to
              clear
              the negative energy between others and ourselves. Instead of communicating in such a way that creates
              opening
              between people, we withdraw, or sulk, or seek revenge.</p>

            <p>If we continue using this habitual language, we become angry, depressed and frustrated because our needs
              are
              not getting met. Nonviolent Communication is about becoming aware of our destructive communication
              patterns
              and remembering our natural language. We learn how to get our needs met in ways that considers other's
              needs.
              When we begin to get our needs met in compassionate ways, patterns of anger and depression change. Instead
              of
              spending time being frustrated, life flows and we have more time to spend meeting other needs such as the
              need
              for meaning and contribution.</p>
